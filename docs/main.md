# Draft
Welcome to your new Draft powered Documentation!

## GitHub Flavored Markdown
The markdown used is GitHub Flavored so you can easily import or export your documentation to GitHub. Remember you can also use some HTML inside Markdown, and if that's not enough you can always write your documentation in HTML documents.

## Examples
You can see some examples right now, just open the examples section in the navigation bar.
